# Merry Christmas, Mombo and Pa

This is a happy place.

---

This is kind of like a blog, but can be contributed by everyone (with parental supervision of course). 

This is a place to share memories. This is a place to connect as a family. This is more than tagging someone on a Facebook post. This is like a living, breathing, growing family scrap book - just for Mombo and Pa. 

Its really easy for every body in the family to use...you can snap a picture with your phone, say a few words about it, and upload a new post all from the app. The website does the rest of the formatting.

Or, if you so chose, you could write something longer. Is there something you want all the kids to know when they get older? Maybe recipes to share? A really funny memory? This is the place for it, safely stored and backed up and not owned by Facebook - not shared with anyone you don't want to share with.

This is a place for warm and fuzzies and laughs.
